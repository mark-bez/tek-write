= Useful usages
:imagesdir: assets/images/posts/2022

The next time I'm having trouble deciding what title to give a topic, I'm going to take the advice of the ScanSnap technical writer and just call it _Useful Usages_.

In fact, I could save a lot of time and use it for EVERY topic in my publication.
What do you think?
