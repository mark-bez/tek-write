= Aspiration
:imagesdir: assets/images/posts/2020

I am compelled to do this but it won't be easy.

== Why?

I am a lucky technical writer.
Lucky because I actually enjoy what I do.

I also love learning, and analyzing, and improving.
Sitting at my desk, working quietly on a new skill or new area of study is its own reward.
There is one thing missing, though, and that is a way to share the enjoyment of my journey.

I am compelled to let loose some of the notes stored on my hard drive and ideas stored in my brain.
That is the aspiration for this blog. No more, no less.

== Opportunity cost

I am far from being new to technical writing, so why have I waited so long?
Mostly, it comes down to the opportunity cost of time, money, and mental energy.
That's the short way of saying the following things.

If you actually want to have a readership, maintaining a blog is a significant time commitment.
I have dabbled in blog-writing before, so I know.

Being in the early stage of raising my third child, while knowing the imperative of keeping children near the top of our priority list, time is inevitably a daily problem for me.
Being time-poor can impact health.
If I am struggling to find a couple of hours a week to exercise while spending five hours a week writing a blog, it is hard to argue that this is not a poor lifestyle choice.
Similarly, sleep deprivation leading to a weakened immune system does not seem to be a sensible ansiwer either.

On the money side, for some of my career I have been an independent consultant working for an hourly rate.
At these times I could not entertain spending ten hours a week writing blog posts when I could be working on an assignment bringing in money for the family.
Ten hours of lost revenue a week is more than a mortgage.

The long and short of it is that raising children, succeeding in a busy job, nurturing a marriage, maintaining a healthy body, and setting aside at least some time for recreation that is essential for good mental health does not leave much remaining discretionary time.
Hence, the opportunity costing of time, money, and mental energy.

== A real and significant challenge

This is all a real and significant challenge.
Yet, with all of that, I still keep coming back to that song, "If not now, then when?".
This is REALLY true in my case.
If I don't start this now I KNOW it will never happen, I need to somehow make this happen.

As you see, there are quite a few items in the minus column.
Although, I admit the plus column is not strong enough to truly overpower the minus column, there are some worthy items in there.

== A rabbit hole

I recently went down an internet rabbit hole, starting with an article about vintage typewriters and leading to an article describing a piece in Glamour magazine about how Danielle Steel has managed to write over 170 books.
Her work ethic is incomparable â€” working for up to 20 hours a day until she falls asleep exhausted.
Now, I can't live on four hours of sleep a night, but her story is inspiring nonetheless.
There must surely be a way I can find a little more discipline and exchange some rabbit-hole activities for some blog writing.

Another inspiration has been a YouTube video by Ali Abdaal.
His message is to just start.
He says don't worry about quality at the beginning.
It is more important to publish frequently and focus on your process than to try and create the perfect piece.
By focusing on the proocess over time the quality and creation efficiency will naturally improve.
I like this hec advice because it lowers the barrier of entry.
Or, as us biochemists might say, it lowers the activation energy (E~A~) of the reaction.

== Typewriters

Also in the plus column (I think anyway) is the pencil and typewriter.
Say again?
Yep, the typewriter.
To counteract the computer-by-day AND computer-by-night syndrome, I have decided to keep my writing workflow as analog as possible.
Brainstorming, outlining, and drafting with a good pencil and then typing with a manual typewriter will get me off the computer and bring a different feel to the process.
In fact, I am curious about how this retro move will impact the outcome.
The compose-and-edit-as-you-go workflow of computer writing may not ultimately be the best way.
Either way, staying off the computer until the last step of scanning and coding sounds like more fun.
And more fun equals lower E~A~.

== Deep breath

So, this is it.
I know I am really up against it, but I have wanted to do this for a long time and,"If not now then when".
Deep breath and chocks away!
