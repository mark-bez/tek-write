STATUS:
Making a concept map for this subject. Transfer headings to this file once the organization and outline is complete.

As modern technical writers write in plain text files opened and edited with a text editor.
For writers transitioning to plain text writing, it can be difficult to figure out how make the best use of a text editor.
In this article, we'll look at the features available in text editors that make it faster and more enjoyable to write plain text documents.

== Background

Working in a text editor is very different from working in a word processor such as Microsoft Word or a page layout program such as Adobe FrameMaker.
It's also different from working in a specialized XML editor, such as OxygenXML, which you might use if you're writing in DITA or DocBook XML.
And it's different from working in a specialized HTML editor, such as Dreamweaver, which you might (but hopefully won't) use if you're directly coding websites.

There are scores of different text editors you can use for technical writing.
They vary widely, from the basic Windows Notepad to the mid-range Notepad++, and the advanced Sublime Text and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

== Basic features

All text editors obviously allow you to open, read, and edit text.
Most also support basic functions such as:

* Cut, copy, and paste
* Undo/redo
* Formatting, such as text wrapping and font selection
* Find specific text within a file

== Essential features

While you can use any text editor for technical writing, more advanced text editors have some features that make writing faster and more pleasant.
I would list these as the most important, not in any particular order:

.Display features
* Multiple windows
* Section folding
* Syntax highlighting
* Colorscheme

.Editing features
* Multiple cursors
* Column-based editing
* Spellcheck
* Speed
* Multiple views into a file
* Vertical line motion

.File management features
* Find and replace across many files in a folder
* Find and replace with regular expressions
* The ability to visualize the differences between two files

.Configuration features
* The ability to create your own shortcuts and run macros to make repetitive tasks easier
* The ability to extend capabilities with plugins

=== Multiple windows

=== Section folding

=== Syntax highlighting

=== Colorschemes

=== Multiple cursors

=== Column-based editing

=== Spellcheck

=== Opening the same file twice

=== Moving lines up and down

=== Find and replace across multiple files

=== Regular expressions

=== Visualize differences

=== Speed

In some text editors, opening large files can slow down performance, with the editor taking seconds to respond to keystrokes.
Other text editors are optimized for performance by only loading into memory the text that is currently showing on the screen.

== Other useful features

Other features some writers may find useful are:

* Integration with Git
* The ability to preview an output within the editor
