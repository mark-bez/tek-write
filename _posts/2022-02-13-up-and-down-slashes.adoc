= The mysterious case of the up and down slashes
:figure-caption!:
:imagesdir: assets/images/posts/2022

I have consistently struggled to remember which keyboard key is the forward slash and which is the backslash, but until now have never taken the time to figure out a way to remember it.
If you also have trouble with slashes, or are curious about where their names come from, this article is for you.

== Naming inconsistency

When starting my analysis, I first noticed the naming inconsistency.
The keys are named _forward slash_ and _backslash_, not _forward slash_ and _back**ward** slash_.
There is a reason for this, which I will come back to later.

== Naming origins

As forward and back(ward) are directions, can we assume these keys are named for the direction their diagonals point in?
Let's examine this idea.

In western languages we read from left to right.
This must mean that a forward slash diagonal points forward, which is to the right, as shown in the following diagram. 

image::slash-direction.svg[Image of slash key direction]

It does point forward. 
It also points up.

Logically, this means the backslash must point backward (left).
Let's take a look.

image::backslash-direction.svg[Image of backslash key direction]

Reading from the left, the backslash diagonal actually points forward and down.
It doesn't point backward at all.
It is impossible for the diagonal to point against the reading direction.

Logically, we should really call these keys the _upslash_ and _downslash_, also making easier to remember them.

But, since when was the English language logical?

== Positional mnemonic

After failing in my first attempt to remember which key is which by applying naming logic, I next looked at the positions of the keys on the keyboard.
I wondered if I could find a positional mnemonic that would help.
Sure enough, the **Back**slash key lies directly underneath the **BACK**SPACE key as you can see in the following photo.

By elimination, this makes the diagonal key on the bottom row next to the SHIFT key the forward slash.

Therefore, if a colleague dictating a filepath over Zoom says, "Backslash" she means the key under the BACKSPACE key.
As my keyboards have the word 'BACKSPACE' printed on the key, it is easy for me to know which key to press.
If my colleague says, "Forward slash" I know to press the diagonal key that is NOT under the BACKSPACE key.

I should note that instead of the word 'BACKSPACE', other keyboards use an arrow, the word 'delete', or something else.
If you have one of those keyboards, I trust you can do the necessary quick mental translation.

That is all well and good, but what if I'm in a coffee shop reading a book about regular expressions and have no computer to refer to? 
Here is a regular expression from a book that I have probably taken to a coffee shop at some time.

How do I know the right way to say these slashes?
My positional mnemonic doesn't help because I don't have my computer to refer to.
It was time to dig deeper. 
Maybe if I understand the origins of these diagonal marks there will be a clue that will help me remember which is which.

== The slash 

I have a giant desktop typewriter that was made in 1956.
It has a forward slash key below the question mark but no backslash key.

image::typewriter-slash.jpg[]

A little research shows that the forward slash key has been used on typewriters since the 1800's, although it isn't always on the bottom row.
A trip over to Wikipedia shows that the forward diagonal punctuation mark has an even longer history.
It has been in general use since medieval times when, among other things, it was used to separate lines in the following manner.

[quote, Robert Frost]
The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, */* But I have promises to keep, */* And miles to go before I sleep"

This diagonal punctuation mark has numerous other historical names, such as virgule, stroke, oblique, and solidus.
However, since the early 60's it has generally been known as just the _slash_.

So, that's the slash. 
What about the backslash?

== The backslash

Vintage typewriters have no backslash key, but do modern typewriters have it? 
There is a company called Nakajima that still makes (electronic) typewriters, and from photos it is clear they also have no backslash key.

It seems, then, that the slash has been used for a long time and is the only diagonal key used on typewriters. 
The backslash key is specific to computing.

Wikipedia says that the character we now know as the backslash first appeared on teletype (teleprinter) machines in the 1930's although it is not known what it was used for.
The following photo shows the slash key on the far right of the front row and the backslash character above it.

Much later, in the 1960's, IBM needed an extra character to represent new programming elements and they re-used the teletype character.
They gave it the name 'backslash' because the direction of the diagonal is opposite from that of the slash.

== Slash key naming ambiguity

With the addition of the backslash key to the computer keyboard, a little ambiguity was introduced.

If we say, "Slash" do we really mean just slash or might we possibly mean backslash? 
To eliminate the ambiguity it has become common for people to say 'forward slash' instead of 'slash'.
I’ve definitely been in the forward slash camp, but now that I understand the historical context I plan to defect.
Plain 'slash' is good enough for me now.

The way the name 'forward slash' grew up explains the naming inconsistency noted at the beginning of this article.
The name 'backslash' was used to distinguish the new key needed for computing from the general 'slash' key.
To make it clear that a slash really is a slash, we could use any antonym of back, such as 'hind', 'fore', or 'rear'.
However, 'hindslash', 'foreslash', and 'rearslash' don't sound that great  so, I guess, the term 'forward slash' stuck as the best option.

== North Star mnemonic

Now, let’s return to the book-in-a-coffee-shop problem.
If I am reading a book to myself and come across a "/", how do I know whether to say slash or backslash? 
The first clue is in the subject matter of the book.
If the book has nothing to do with computing, the diagonal character is almost certainly the plain ol' general purpose slash you and I have been using for years to write fractions such as 1/2 and 1/4 and dates such as 2022/02/20.
People were typing fractions and dates on typewriters long before computers existed, and that is what the diagonal key at the bottom of the typewriter keyboard is for.

But what if, like my regular expressions book, the subject matter is about computing and has both types of slash?
Remember this?

Knowing that the diagonal character in fractions (1/2) is the vintage, original slash should be all we need to translate the symbols into words.
But, just to be thorough, I still wanted to find a mnemonic that I could picture in my mind because visuals always help.

Here's what I came up with.

image::north-star.svg[]

In this mnemonic, the ENTER (RETURN) key is our North Star, the guiding point in the sky (at least for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere).
Everything points to the North Star.
In the standard western reading direction, from left to right, the bottom-row slash diagonal points up to the 'North Star'.
The backslash diagonal near the top points down to the 'North Star'.
The slash points up and the backslash points down.

And here's one more visual. 
Outstretch your right arm to make a vintage slash.
Now, pivot your arm at the shoulder *back* the other way to the left to make a **back**slash.

== When to use each slash

To end this story, here is a reminder of when to use the slash and backslash keys.

Use the slash in everyday contexts such as:

* Dates (2022/02/20) 
* Fractions (1/4) 
* To separate choices (yes/no) 
* For page numbers and total page counts (17/64) 
* For two-letter initialisms (A/C, b/w) 
* For abbreviations (/w, b/c) 

Use the slash in computing for: 

* UNIX and MacOS local and network filepath directory separators (/home/mark/Pictures/photo.jpg)
* Internet URLs (http://www.tek-write.com)
* Commandline switches (dir /A /F > dir.txt) 
* HTML and XML closing tags (<p>This is a paragraph.</p>) 

Use the backslash in computing for: 

* Windows local and network filepath directory separators (C:\Users\mark\Documents\notes\a-note.txt)
* Special character escapes used in text editing (for example in regular expressions \n means newline and \t means tab)
